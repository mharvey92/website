      <p><b>The Greenhouse Effect</b></p>
      <p>
      <p>Throughout time our climate system has been varied due to natural causes. However, as data shows from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), around the start of the Industrial Revolution our climate started to change due to human activities. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions, mostly due to humans burning fossil fuels, has added substantially to what is known as the Greenhouse Effect.  The Greenhouse Effect causes the Earth’s system to retain heat. This occurs when greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and others, absorb heat from the earth surface instead of allowing the heat to exit the Earth’s system. This heat is then re-released into the atmosphere causing the Earth’s temperature to rise. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <p><b>Greenhouse Gases</b></p>
      <p>
      <p> There are four main types of greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, noxious oxide, and fluorinated gases.  According to the EPA, <b>carbon dioxide</b> made up 82% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2013.  This gas is released into the atmosphere when coal, natural gas, and oil, are burned. Additionally, this gas is released when solid waste is burned and when cement is made. <b>Methane</b> made up 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2013, and is released when coal, natural gas, and oil is produced. Methane can also be emitted from agricultural and livestock processes. <b>Nitrous oxide</b> and <b>fluorinated gases</b> made up 7% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2013, and primarily comes from industrial processes. Since carbon dioxide is the predominant greenhouse gas produced in the United States and around the world, it is the focus of most greenhouse gas emission data. </p> 
      <p><b>What Industry Sectors Do Carbon Emissions Come From?</b></p>
      <p>
      <p>In 2010, the EPA started the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Since the program’s inception, large businesses within the United States, that release over 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, are required to report their output.  The EPA has posted this data to their website. For this project the programming language Python was used to scrape data on total carbon emission output by sector. The data was then sorted using the Python module Pandas. The industry sectors with the most carbon emissions in 2014 are reported in the table to the right. </p>

      <p><b>Where in the United States Do Most Carbon Emissions Come From?</b></p>
      <p>The highest outputs of carbon emissions come of course from some of the most populated states. According to data from the World Resources Institute (WRI), Texas, California, and Pennsylvania are the top three states that produce the most carbon emissions. Texas, with its vast oil industry, is an extreme outlier in producing carbon emissions. In 2012, Texas’ greenhouse gas emissions totaled 804.83 MtCO2e, a little over 12% of the U.S. total. California, the state with the second highest greenhouse gas emissions, emitted approximately half (444.34 MtCO2e) of what Texas released in the same year. Pennsylvania, the state with the third highest emissions, produced a total of 276.91 MtCO2e, excluding land-use change. </p>
      <p>
      <p>However, to get a better idea of what states release the most carbon emissions while accounting for population we must look at per capita carbon emissions. To do this the Python module Pandas was used to calculate each states’ per capita carbon emissions from 2012. These calculations were then multiplied by 1 million in order to change the units from MtCO2e to tCO2e. Tableau Public was used to create a chloropleth map (to the left), based on per capita emissions. States colored dark green produced a relatively high amount of per capita carbon emissions, whereas states colored light green produced a relatively low amount. Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia had the top per capita carbon emissions in 2012. </p>

      <p><b>Where in the World Do Most Carbon Emissions Come From?</b></p>
      <p>China, the United States, and India produce more greenhouse gases than any other countries around the world. China alone produces 24% of the world’s carbon emissions, with the United States and India producing approximately 14% and 7% respectively. If we account for population and look at per capita emissions, China ranks 57 out of 185 countries examined, United States ranks 16, and India ranks 131. Kuwait, Brunei Darussalam, and Qatar produce more carbon emissions per capita than any other countries around the world. The world map to the right was made in the statistical programming language R, and shows each country’s per capita emissions in units of tCO2e. Countries colored in red have a relatively high per capita carbon emission rate, whereas countries colored in yellow have a relatively low rate.</p>
      <p><b>Into the Future</b></p>
      <p>Using the World Bank’s Climate Data API, it is possible to look at average annual temperature predictions for the years 2020-2099. After extracting this data from the API with the program Python, we can see that the predicted annual average temperature for 2020 is 37.15 degrees. In 2099 the predicted annual average temperature rises to 43.73 degrees. This temperature rise will be in part due to excess greenhouse gases created by human activity. Thus, governments as well as individuals should be proactively working on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Countries with high carbon emissions and per capita emissions should work together to monitor and reduce these harmful gases.  Additionally, governments should help foster development of clean technologies, so that use of petroleum and natural gas can be diminished going forward. Most importantly, individuals should be conscious of their carbon footprint.
